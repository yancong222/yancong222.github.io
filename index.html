    <h2>Hello!</h2> 

    <p>
        I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/">Feinstein Institute for Medical Research</a>. I obtained my PhD in <a href="https://linglang.msu.edu">Linguistics from Michigan State University</a> in August 2021, 
        with an additional specialization in <a href="https://www.cogsci.msu.edu/">Cognitive Science</a>. 
        I am interested in language meaning, specifically, the enriched meaning of degree constructions in context (e.g., adjectives such as <i>tall</i>).
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2> 

    <p>
        My main interests are semantics and pragmatics. This means I study natural language meaning, meaning in context, 
        and how language users reason about these meanings.     
        Computational models, neurophysiology equipment, and behavioral experiments are used in my investigation. 
        Projects details can be found in <a href=https://github.com/yancong222/scripts>GitHub scripts</a> 
        and in my <a href=https://github.com/yancong222/yancong222.github.io/blob/master/cong_resume.pdf>Resume</a>. 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        I aspire to be a teacher-scholar. Before PhD, I did my MA work in language studies (emphasis in L2 acquisition), 
        and BA in Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL).
        My teaching and research experience has come from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and the United States. 
        I have taught English and Chinese as second/foreign languages from novice to advanced levels in face-to-face and online settings. 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Currently, I am using language models and natural language processing (NLP) to better understand neuropsychiatric disorders. 
        In general, we seek to understand and intervene mental illness through the lens of language. 
        In particular, our projects explore NLP methods of digitalizing clinically meaningful speech and language biomarkers for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. 
        Projects details can be found in <a href=https://github.com/yancong222/scriptscz>GitHub scriptscz</a>.
