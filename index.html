    <h2>Hello!</h2> 

    <p>
        I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://linglang.msu.edu">Linguistics</a> program at Michigan State University, 
        with an additional specialization in <a href="https://www.cogsci.msu.edu/">Cognitive Science</a>. 
        I am interested in language meaning and language in use. 
        Currently I am investigating the (enriched) meaning of degree constructions (adjectives such as <i>"expensive"</i>) in context. 
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2> 

    <p>
    My main interests are semantics and pragmatics, among other things. My dissertation aims are characterizing and explaining ambiguity/underspecification pragmatically. 
    I study how speakers reason about meanings and how listeners reason about utterances. For example, by using <i>"I will invite Anna or Kai"</i>, the speaker typically implies they won't invite both, 
    even though strictly speaking, the sentence is compatible with them inviting both. 
    This inference (implicature) arises because <i>"or"</i> competes with <i>"and"</i>: the listener reasons that if the speaker were going to invite both,
    they would have said <i>"I will invite Anna and Kai"</i>, which is more informative/specific. Thus, <i>"or"</i> is routinely enriched to mean <i>"not both"</i>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    With regards to cognitive science, I am looking at how sound features such as rhythm and sonority influence speech perception in noise environment. 
    </p>
