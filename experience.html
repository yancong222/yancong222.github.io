    <p class="abstract">I am interested in using language models to understand speech biomarkers, and using NLP methods to characterize thought disorder in language. 
             You can find the most rencent projects <a href="https://github.com/yancong222/SSD-LM-STanglab.git">here</a></p>

    <p class="abstract">I am interested in the roles of rhythm and sonority in speech perception in noise environment. 
        Our projects explore the cognitive bases of timing and rhythm in human speech. 
        Research program involves topics such as attentional entrainment and the role of rhythm in speech and language processing. 
        I have learned to use a wide range of methodologies during my stay in the TAP lab, including statistical models, behavioral methods with adults, neurology equipment, and computational modeling.</p>
