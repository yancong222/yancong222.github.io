    <p class="abstract">I <a href="https://github.com/yancong222/SSD-LM-STanglab.git">lead projects</a> using transformer based representations of language to understand semantic/pragmatic disorders.
         I am also contributing to projects using natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract linguistic features, 
        characterize thought disorder in language, and assist psychiatrists with their investigations.

         <li>In <a href="https://taplab.psy.msu.edu/">the MSU Timing, Attention, and Perception (TAP) Lab</a> [08/2019 - 08/2021]
    <p class="abstract">I am interested in the roles of rhythm and sonority in speech perception in noise environment. 
        Our projects explore the cognitive bases of timing and rhythm in human speech. 
        Research program involves topics such as attentional entrainment and the role of rhythm in speech and language processing.</p>

    <p class="abstract">I have done research on compounds processing, prosodic lengthening, and semantics attraction (ERP components such as P600).
             Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used in these investigations. </p>

        <li>In <a href="https://msusemantics.weebly.com/">the MSU Semantics/Syntax Lab</a> [08/2016 - 08/2021]
    <p class="abstract">I have done research on formal semantics. Topics include
        syntax-semantics interface, lexical semantics, Gricean pragmatics, and experiments in linguistic meaning.</p>

         <li>At <a href="http://p2u2.cbs.polyu.edu.hk/">the Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> [03/2015 - 07/2016]
    <p class="abstract">I have done corpus studies on world Chineses variations and Ontology. 
             I also played administrative roles. I worked directly with project managers to help implement project goals, 
        assigned duties to staff and liaised with projects leads, as needed, 
        and oversaw variable aspects of Chinese linguistics projects, such as grants arrangement.

    <p class="abstract">I have done theoretical research about fundamentals of generative linguistics, such as c-command relations in syntax 
        and Optimality Theory in phonology.</p>
